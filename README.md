This is my take on [interview cake's questions](https://www.interviewcake.com).

I like most of cake's questions, and the format. They are good review material in most cases, and at other times introduce me to topics I had missed.

As usual with interview questions there are inevitably the questions where you either see the solution (or have seen the solution before) or will just never get what the interviewer is asking for.

And often too, with these, I am indeed amazed at the notion that many of these can be answered

+ on a whiteboard
+ in 20 minutes or less
+ by people with no basic whiteboarding, on the fly, coding experience

If I can do a couple of these in a day, by myself, I'm pretty good with that.

So here are some code snippets to look at, play with, evaluate.

The code was tested in Python 2, though it was written such that it will  probably work as is in Python 3.

The files here can be run by typing:

    python filename

at which point unit tests will kick in, and sort of verify they work. For details though, after

    python filename

you should type

    more|vi|emacs filename

to see the details


A few of the interview cake questions are indeed interview questions and not amenable to coding solutions. This repo contains only the coding.
